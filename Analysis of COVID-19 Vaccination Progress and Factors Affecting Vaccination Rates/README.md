# README File for COVID-19 Data Analysis 

## Limitations
Unfortunately, this project cannot be directly run on Ed Workspace as it creates new tabs for the analysis graphs in the browser, and Ed Workspace does not support these functions.

## How to Run
Our team has already built a working website for 3 months starting from **6/4/2023** using the servers provided by pythonanywhere. If you wish to view it after the expiration date, please email **miked232@uw.edu** as the website can be renewed every 3 months.

If you want to edit the code yourself, simply download the entire dataset and run either `app.py` if you want to create the website with the graphs or `plotly_files.py` if you only want to view the graphs generated by our team.

- `plotly_files.py`: Running this file will generate the graphs we have created in our project report.

- `app.py`: Running this file will create a new website using Flask, which can be accessed at <http://127.0.0.1:5000>.

The `templates` folder contains all the HTML files for each page of the website, enabling the visualization of the graphs.

The `country_vaccinations.csv` file is the dataset provided by Kaggle, which we are analyzing. Further details about the dataset can be found in the **Project Report and Code**.

## Required Libraries and Versions
We used **Python 3.9** to complete this project. The following libraries were used and can be installed using the provided links:

- Flask: <https://pypi.org/project/Flask/>
- Pandas: <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html>
- Plotly: <https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#installation>

## Running the Code
After downloading all the files, including the provided dataset, unzip the files and choose one of the following options:

- `plotly_files.py`: Running this file will generate the graphs we have created in our project report in your IDE.

- `app.py`: Running this file will create a new website at <http://miked232.pythonanywhere.com> using Flask, which includes the graphs and research questions listed for each visualization. The website can be accessed at <http://127.0.0.1:5000>.
